MyHeritage is a widely-used platform for genealogy research and DNA testing. From building family trees to uncovering ancestral origins, it provides users with a powerful toolkit to explore their past. However, like any other app or website, users occasionally experience problems with MyHeritage not working as expected.

Whether the platform won’t load, crashes during use, or specific features like the family tree builder or DNA tools won’t function, there are several common causes and fixes. This article will walk you through everything you need to know to troubleshoot and resolve MyHeritage not working issues effectively.

Common Reasons Why MyHeritage Is Not Working 📌
__________
Before diving into solutions, it helps to understand why you might be experiencing issues. The most common reasons for MyHeritage not working include:

Server downtime or maintenance

Poor or unstable internet connection

Browser compatibility issues

Outdated MyHeritage app version (for mobile users)

Cache and cookie corruption

Software bugs or glitches

Device compatibility issues

Each of these issues can cause MyHeritage to become slow, unresponsive, or completely inaccessible. Thankfully, most of them can be fixed fairly quickly with a few adjustments.

1. Check If MyHeritage Servers Are Down 📌
__________
If you’re trying to use MyHeritage and it’s not loading at all or giving you an error message, the issue may not be on your end. Server outages can occur due to scheduled maintenance, traffic overloads, or unexpected technical issues.

To check this:

Search online or visit a service status website to see if other users are reporting MyHeritage not working.

Check MyHeritage’s official social media channels for updates.

If the servers are down, all you can do is wait until the company resolves the issue.

2. Refresh or Restart the Platform 📌
__________
Sometimes, simply refreshing the browser page or restarting the mobile app can resolve the issue. Minor glitches or temporary freezes are common and can often be fixed this way.

Try the following steps:

On desktop: Press Ctrl + F5 to perform a hard refresh.

On mobile: Close the app completely and reopen it.

If that doesn’t work and you're still experiencing MyHeritage not working, continue with the next steps.

3. Clear Browser Cache and Cookies 📌
__________
Corrupted cache or outdated cookies can interfere with how websites function. If you're using MyHeritage in a browser and noticing issues like blank screens or buttons that don't work, clearing your cache might help.

How to clear cache (general steps):

Go to your browser settings.

Find the option labeled "Clear browsing data" or similar.

Select “Cookies and cached images/files.”

Confirm the action and restart your browser.

After this, log back into MyHeritage and see if the issue is resolved.

4. Try a Different Browser 📌
__________
Another way to fix MyHeritage not working is by switching browsers. Some features may not work well in certain browsers due to compatibility issues. MyHeritage is optimized for modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

If you're having issues:

Try accessing the website using a different browser.

Make sure your browser is updated to the latest version.

5. Update or Reinstall the Mobile App 📌
__________
If you’re using the MyHeritage app on your smartphone or tablet and it’s not functioning correctly, the app may be outdated or experiencing a bug. An easy fix is to update or reinstall the app.

Steps:

Open your device's app store (Google Play or App Store).

Search for "MyHeritage" and check if an update is available.

If yes, update the app.

If not, delete and reinstall the app.

This will ensure you’re using the most stable and recent version of the app, which often resolves MyHeritage not working issues.

6. Check Your Internet Connection 📌
__________
MyHeritage requires a stable internet connection to function correctly. If your internet is weak, intermittent, or disconnected, this could be why MyHeritage is not working.

Try the following:

Run a speed test to check your internet quality.

Restart your router or modem.

Switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data or vice versa to see if the issue improves.

7. Disable Browser Extensions or Ad Blockers 📌
__________
Sometimes, browser extensions like ad blockers or privacy tools can interfere with how MyHeritage loads. These tools can block scripts that are essential for the platform to work.

To test this:

Open your browser in Incognito or Private Mode.

Visit MyHeritage and see if it works.

If it does, the issue is likely an extension conflict.

You can then disable extensions one by one to find the culprit.

8. Try a Different Device 📌
__________
If you're still experiencing MyHeritage not working, it might be an issue with your device itself. To rule this out:

Try accessing MyHeritage from another device (different PC, smartphone, or tablet).

If it works there, your original device may have settings or software issues affecting the site.

9. Contact MyHeritage Support 📌
__________
If you’ve tried everything and MyHeritage is still not working, it’s time to contact support. MyHeritage has a customer support team that can assist with account issues, data errors, and technical glitches.

Before contacting them, make sure to:

Document what you've tried already.

Include screenshots or error messages.

Provide details about your browser, device, and operating system.

This will help the support team diagnose and fix the issue more efficiently.
